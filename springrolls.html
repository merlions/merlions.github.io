					<p class="label">Ingredients:</p>
					<li>1 Tablespoon oil</li>
					<li>1lb ground pork, chicken, and/or shrimp each</li>
					<li>1/2 cup each chopped onion</li>
					<li>1/2 cup minced carrots</li>
					<li>1/2 cup chopped green onions</li>
					<li>1/2 cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
					<li>30 wrappers (spring roll or egg roll - spring roll wrappers are thinner 
					and you can find them in the freezer section of an Asian market)</li>
					<li>Oil to fry in</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div id="instructions">
					<p>Place a wok or large skillet over high heat, and pour in 1 tablespoon 
					vegetable oil. Cook pork, stirring frequently, until no pink is showing. 
					Remove pork from pan and set aside. Drain grease from pan, leaving a 
					thin coating. Cook garlic and onion in the same pan for 2 minutes. 
					Stir in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, and cabbage. Season 
					with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from heat, and 
					set aside until cool enough to handle.</p>
					<p>Place three heaping tablespoons of the filling diagonally near one 
					corner of each wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both ends. Fold 
					the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in 
					both ends, and roll neatly. Keep the roll tight as you assemble. 
					Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. 
					Cover the rolls with plastic wrap to retain moisture.</p>
					<p>Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil to 1/2 inch depth, 
					and heat for 5 minutes. Slide 3 or 4 lumpia into the oil. Fry the 
					rolls for 1 to 2 minutes, until all sides are golden brown. Drain on 
					paper towels. Serve immediately.</p>
