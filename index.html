			<p>Hello to all Bryans, Giuffres, Denaburgs, and outlaws! I hope this is a helpful resource. I built it several years ago 
			but never ended up publishing it. Honestly, even if no one ends up using it, I feel very excited about finally getting it up somewhere after all these years!<!-- Hopefully I'll put some photos from reunions, weddings, and 
			other family events up here soon but for now it'll just be mostly empty on this front page. Sorry about that!--></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, it always slips my mind to ask for new recipes at the beach but please feel free to send me any you want included. I'll try to keep up with any I see exchanged! </p><p>
			I've tried to directly quote any recipe I've been given but may have made some errors, and the coding with this has gone through so many changes it's possible some wild nonsense might happen with the web hosting platform I'm using. If you have a recipe you'd like to add or change, want to give feedback on anything, or if you 
			notice a problem with the website, you can text me at (541) 602-9801, 
			or email me at <a href="mailto:bryanchrisj@gmail.com">
			bryanchrisj@gmail.com</a> (link opens to an external mail application). </p>
<p>Stay safe out there everyone! Lots of love to all.
			</p>
			<p>Chris</p>
